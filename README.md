# HiT-Histories in Transition

**HiT-Astro** is an application for managing and interacting with a collection of manuscripts and historical data, built using [Astro](https://astro.build/). For more on the project itself see the about page as well as the project site in the [ACDH website](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/research/dh-research-infrastructure/activities/web-development/hit-histories-in-transition).

## Datamodel

This project uses the data model defined in [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/d/HiT-6731b349e9daa85acafee5fa) to organize and store manuscripts, codicological units, manuscript items, works, authors, genres, and related metadata. 
To suit the researchers' aim the data is entered in a relational database [baserow](https://baserow.io/). This data is dumped on a regular basis in a [sister repository](https://github.com/histories-in-transition/hit-baserow-dump). The JSON files are then processed in the current repository, making visualizations and advanced filtered search possible.  


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Package Manager**: This project uses `pnpm`. If you haven't installed it:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```
2. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/histories-in-transition/hit-astro.git
	cd hit-astro
	```

3. **Installation**
	1. Install dependencies:
	```bash
	pnpm install
 	```
	2. Configure the application:
	   Currently the application uses a base path: 'hit-astro' set in `astro.config.mjs` 
    3. To run the project locally:
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

## Project Structure

-   **`src/content/`**: Contains collections and JSON data files (fetched using the scripts in the scripts folder). 
-   **`src/components/`**: Contains *astro* components such as header, footer etc.
-   **`src/pages/`**: Contains the web pages to tables (of manuscripts, works etc.) or detail view of single items (manuscripts, works etc).
-   **`src/lib/`**: Contains scripts for the advanced search, and the [Tabulator library](https://tabulator.info/) used to display JSON data in tables.
-   `src/lib/advanced search` and `src/pages/search.astro` (search interface): Implements the search page with (Algolia) instant search (using [Typsesence instance search adapter](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/search-ui-components.html#using-instantsearch-js)).
-   **`scripts/`**: Scripts for fetching data.

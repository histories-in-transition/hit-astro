			<p>
				The project aims to challenge the current understanding of the cultural history of
				historiography in the Carolingian and post-Carolingian world (9th–12th centuries) through an
				innovative and precisely focussed investigation of two major centres of historical writing
				during this period, Salzburg and Freising. We want to explore how in the course of the
				transformation of the Carolingian World, the ways of thinking about, organising, compiling
				and writing history changed between the 9th and 12th centuries.

				A central aspect of the project is the creation of a relational database that enables users
				to analyse and visualise the chronological layers and connections between the manuscripts.
